# Meta_QC

## Description
Quality control tool for metagenomic assemblies.
We will create a tool to identify errors in assembly creation based on short reads. Examples of errors are: inversions, chimeras (translocation), indels (<50bp), replacements (large substitutions)

## Datasets
+ Zymo Assembly (8 genomes; 3 gram positive, 3 gram negative, 2 yeast)
+ Shakaya Assembly (Megahit)
