# Meta_QC

## Goal
Our goal is to identify errors in assembly creation based on short reads. Examples of errors are: inversions, chimeras (translocation), indels (<50bp), replacements (large substitutions)

## Workflow

+ Shakaya Assembly (Megahit)

## Methods
This will be updated as project continues.

## Key Results
This will be updated after project completion.

## Future Directions
